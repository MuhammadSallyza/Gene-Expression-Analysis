I created sample work folder to share sample of projects that I did.
Gene Expression Analysis was run on R Studio in order to understand which Breast cancer gene has the highest and lower expression rate. The level of expression rate on certain gene may increase or lower cancer risk.
Survival Analysis on Colorectal Cancer Data was done on R Studio to see how mutation may affect the patient survival.
Classification was done on Python where we required to classified MRI Image using CNN. Several pre trained model such as AlexNet, ResNet80, VGG16, optimisation  namely Adam and AdamW and data augmentation were applied. Results were recorded and compared.
